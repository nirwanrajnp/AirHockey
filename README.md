# P5.js Arcade Game - AirHockey

This is an arcade game, Air Hockey. I made this when I started coding. 

## Setup

1. install [Atom](https://atom.io/) (Windows, OSX or Linux)

2. install
   the
   [Live Server](https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server)
   and [Color Picker](https://atom.io/packages/color-picker) packages (if you
   use the `apm` tool it's just `apm install atom-live-server color-picker`)

## Use

1. clone this repository somewhere

2. open the folder in Atom and start the atom live server (`Packages >
   atom-live-server > Start server` or `Ctrl+Alt+L`)
